# Nutrient Levels in the Bisley Watershed (Puerto Rico) Before and After Hurricane Hugo

This repository contains raw and processed data accessed from the Environmental Data Initiative on the chemistry of stream water from the Luqillo Mountains in Puerto Rico from 1986-2020. Data from 4 sites within the Bisley watershed were analyzed to recreate Fig. 3 in Schaefer et al. 2000. The data were wrangled to create a 1 month rolling average between 1988-1994 to plot the stream nutrient levels of NO2, NH4, K, Ca, and Mg before and after Hurricane Hugo (1990).
