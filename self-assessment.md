## Automate

#### *Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document*

Not yet: need to move pieces of analysis into the quarto doc by sourcing them once I am done

#### The analysis runs without errors

Meets spec

#### *The analysis produces the expected output*

Not yet: I have not yet combined multiple sites into one graph

#### *Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)*

Not yet: Need to separate cleaning and import

## Organize

#### Raw data is contained in its own folder

Meets spec: everything is within 'data'

#### Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

Meets spec: test script is a separate folder

#### *At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file*

Meets spec: function is within R

## Document

#### The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

Not yet: I do not have the outputs being properly cited

#### *The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works*

Not yet: need to make a clean flowchart in canva

#### *The code is appropriately commented*

Not yet: need to go through line by line and explain all steps

#### *Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention*

Meets spec: all using lower snake case and descriptive of function/ purpose so far

## Scale

#### Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

Meets spec: all necessary libraries being loaded into the top of documents

#### The analysis script runs without errors

Meets spec: so far

## Collaborate

#### *The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review*

Not yet: have not completed peer feedback session yet

#### *The student has contributed to a peerâ€™s repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request*

Not yet: same issue as above

#### The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

Not yet: about to do this

#### The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

Meets spec: had about 3 of these already

#### The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages

Meets spec: just set up pages!
